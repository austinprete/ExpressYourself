Right now this is just a simple chat web application that automatically translates messages depending on the users current language setting. Eventually it will have private conversation options as well as chatroom capabilities. 

Note: This application was based off of a sample by FriendFeed/Facebook and I wrote the code (Python and Javascript) that is unique to my web application.
